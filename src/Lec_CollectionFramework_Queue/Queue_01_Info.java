#Queue Interface
Queue interface maintains the first-in-first-out order. (FIFO)
It can be defined as an ordered list that is used to hold the elements which are about to be processed. 

linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
 A good example of queue is any queue of custtomer in a back for a service where the customer that came first is served first.

Deque Interface:
Deque interface extends the Queue interface. In Deque, we can remove and add the elements from both the side. 
Deque stands for a double-ended queue which enables us to perform the operations at both the ends.

DeQueue=Double Ended Queue


PriorityQueue:

holds the elements or objects which are to be processed by their priorities
PriorityQueue doesn't allow null values to be stored in the queue
